# Movie Recommendation System with GUI

This project presents the development and implementation of a movie recommendation system integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter library. The recommendation system employs natural language processing techniques, specifically TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user input.

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations
- User-friendly GUI using Tkinter
- Real-time recommendation updates
- Handling missing data and text cleaning
- Visually appealing and customizable interface

## Dataset

### TMDB Movies Dataset

The dataset utilized consists of movie metadata, including overviews and titles, sourced from the TMDB Movie Dataset. The dataset includes:

- Movie titles
- Movie overviews
- Metadata for various movies

You can find the TMDB Movies Dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).
